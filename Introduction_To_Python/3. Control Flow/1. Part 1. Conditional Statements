# If Statement
# An if statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips
# code based on whether a condition is true or false. Here's a simple example.
#
if phone_balance < 5:
    phone_balance += 10
    bank_balance -= 10
# Let's break this down.
#
# An if statement starts with the if keyword, followed by the condition to be checked,
# in this case phone_balance < 5, and then a colon. The condition is specified in a boolean expression
# that evaluates to either True or False.
#
# After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if that condition is true.
# Here, the lines that increment phone_balance and decrement bank_balance only execute if
# it is true that phone_balance is less than 5. If not, the code in this if block is simply skipped.

# Use Comparison Operators in Conditional Statements
# You have learned about Python's comparison operators (e.g. == and !=)
# and how they are different from assignment operators (e.g. =).
# In conditional statements, you want to use comparison operators.
# For example, you'd want to use if x == 5 rather than if x = 5.
# If your conditional statement is causing a syntax error or doing
# something unexpected, check whether you have written == or =!
