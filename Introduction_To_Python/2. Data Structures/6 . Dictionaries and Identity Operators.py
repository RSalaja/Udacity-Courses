# Dictionaries And Identity Operators

# Dictionaries
# A dictionary is a mutable data type that stores mappings of unique keys to values.
# Here's a dictionary that stores elements and their atomic numbers.

elements = {"hydrogen": 1, "helium": 2, "carbon": 6}

# Dictionaries can have keys of any immutable type, like integers or tuples,
# not just strings. It's not even necessary for every key to have the same type!
# We can look up values or insert new values in the dictionary using square brackets that enclose the key.

print(elements["helium"])  # print the value mapped to "helium"
elements["lithium"] = 3  # insert "lithium" with a value of 3 into the dictionary

# We can check whether a value is in a dictionary the same way we check whether a
# value is in a list or set with the in keyword. Dicts have a related method that's
# also useful, get. get looks up values in a dictionary, but unlike square brackets,
# get returns None (or a default value of your choice) if the key isn't found.

print("carbon" in elements)
print(elements.get("dilithium"))

# Carbon is in the dictionary, so True is printed.
# Dilithium isnâ€™t in our dictionary so None is returned by get and then printed.
# If you expect lookups to sometimes fail, get might be a better tool
# than normal square bracket lookups because errors can crash your program.

# Identity Operators
# Keyword	Operator
# is	    evaluates if both sides have the same identity
# is not	evaluates if both sides have different identities

# You can check if a key returned None with the is operator.
# You can check for the opposite using is not.

n = elements.get("dilithium")
print(n is None)
print(n is not None)

# Quiz: Define a Dictionary
# Define a dictionary named population that contains this data:

# Keys	    Values
# Shanghai	17.8
# Istanbul	13.3
# Karachi	13.0
# Mumbai	12.5

# Define a Dictionary, population,
# that provides information
# on the world's largest cities.
# The key is the name of a city
# (a string), and the associated
# value is its population in
# millions of people.

#   Key     |   Value
# Shanghai  |   17.8
# Istanbul  |   13.3
# Karachi   |   13.0
# Mumbai    |   12.5


# population = {"Shanghai" : 17.8,
#               "Istanbul" : 13.3,
#               "Karachi" : 13.0,
#               "Mumbai" : 12.5}
#
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = a
# c = [1, 2, 3]
#
# print(a == b)
# print(a is b)
# print(a == c)
# print(a is c)
#
# animals = {'dogs': [20, 10, 15, 8, 32, 15], 'cats': [3,4,2,8,2,4], 'rabbits': [2, 3, 3], 'fish': [0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.3, 1]}
# k = animals['dogs'],animals['dogs'][3],animals[3],animals['fish']
# print(k)


elements = {'hydrogen': {'number': 1, 'weight': 1.00794, 'symbol': 'H'},
            'helium': {'number': 2, 'weight': 4.002602, 'symbol': 'He'}}

# todo: Add an 'is_noble_gas' entry to the hydrogen and helium dictionaries
# hint: helium is a noble gas, hydrogen isn't

elements = {'hydrogen': {'number': 1, 'weight': 1.00794, 'symbol': 'H'},
            'helium': {'number': 2, 'weight': 4.002602, 'symbol': 'He'}}
