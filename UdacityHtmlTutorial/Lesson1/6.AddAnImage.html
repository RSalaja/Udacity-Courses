How to complete this exercise
Look at the Workspace, below. 
You'll find the file index.html inside. 
Edit index.html in the workspace and watch your website change in the preview panel.

For this exercise, you need to create an image tag in the space provided and link it to the URL given in the HTML comment. Here's an example of what the HTML for an image element would look like:

<img src="http://somewebsite.com/image.jpg" alt="short description">
I want you to:

Create an <img> tag at the designated spot in the paragraph below.
Set the source to: http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png
Set the tag's alt attribute to a description of the image (maybe something like, "Udacity logo").

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
  <p>
    This is a big paragraph of text about Udacity. 
    Cool. Cool. And here is an image!<img src=" http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png">    <!-- put the image element here! -->
