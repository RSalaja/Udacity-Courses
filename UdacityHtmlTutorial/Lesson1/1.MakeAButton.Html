<!--
You create button elements the same way you've been creating other 
elements: <tag>content</tag>. In this case, the tag name is button 
and the content that comes between the tags will be the text displayed 
inside the button. Here's more about buttons on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).

When you create your button, make sure you include some text content so 
that the button says something â€” it can be whatever you want!

If you want to see what your button looks like 
(you don't have to for this quiz), simply create an HTML 
file with a button element and open it in your browser!
