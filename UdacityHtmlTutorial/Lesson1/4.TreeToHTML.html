You're going to build the HTML for the image, above. 
Take a close look at the relationships in the tree. 
Pay attention to parents, children, and siblings. 
Notice that some elements have text content.

Look at the Workspace, below. You'll find the file index.html inside. 
Edit index.html in the workspace and watch your website change in the preview panel.

For this exercise, I want you to:

Add an <h1> tag with some content.
Add a <div> tag.
Add two paragraph tags as child elements to the<div>.
Add text content to each paragraph element.

    <!-- Did you notice that the body tag - 
    the top of the sample tree - is already here? 
    You don't need to add another one. When you're done,
    you can click over to the solution.html to check your work.-->
