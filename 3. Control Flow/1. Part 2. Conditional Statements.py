# If, Elif, Else
# In addition to the if clause,
# there are two other optional clauses often used with an if statement. For example:

if season == 'spring':
    print('plant the garden!')
elif season == 'summer':
    print('water the garden!')
elif season == 'fall':
    print('harvest the garden!')
elif season == 'winter':
    print('stay indoors!')
else:
    print('unrecognized season')

# if:
# An if statement must always start with an if clause,
# which contains the first condition that is checked.
# If this evaluates to True, Python runs the code
# indented in this if block and then skips to the
# rest of the code after the if statement.

# elif:
# elif is short for "else if."
# An elif clause is used to check for
# an additional condition if the conditions
# in the previous clauses in the if statement evaluate to False.
# As you can see in the example, you can have multiple elif blocks
# to handle different situations.

# else:
# Last is the else clause,
# which must come at the end of an
# if statement if used. This clause doesn't require a condition.
# The code in an else block is run if all conditions above that
# in the if statement evaluate to False.
