# Q5-1: Measuring Speed
# Why do computer scientists focus on measuring how time scales with input size, instead of absolute
# time? (Check all correct answers.)
# a. We want to predict how long it will take for a program to execute before running it.
# b. We want to know how the time will change as computers get faster.
# c. We want to understand fundamental properties of our algorithms, not things specific to a
# particular input or machine.
# d. We want abstract answers, so they can never be wrong.
# Throughout the entire history of computing, it's been the case that the computer you can buy in a
# year for the same amount of money will be faster than the computer you can buy today.
