# Slice and Dice with Lists
# You saw that we can pull more than one value from a list at a time by using slicing.
# When using slicing, it is important to remember that the lower index is inclusive and
# the upper index is exclusive.

# Therefore, this:
list_of_random_things = [1, 3.4, 'a string', True]
list_of_random_things[1:2]
# [3.4]

# will only return 3.4 in a list. Notice this is still different than just indexing
# a single element, because you get a list back with this indexing.
# The colon tells us to go from the starting value on the left of the
# colon up to, but not including, the element on the right.

# If you know that you want to start at the beginning,
# of the list you can also leave out this value.

list_of_random_things[:2]
# [1, 3.4]

# or to return all of the elements to the end of the list,
# we can leave off a final element.

list_of_random_things[1:]
# [3.4, 'a string', True]

# This type of indexing works exactly the same on strings,
# where the returned value will be a string.

# Are you in OR not in?

# You saw that we can also use in and not in to return a bool of whether
# an element exists within our list, or if one string is a substring of another.

'this' in 'this is a string'
# True
'in' in 'this is a string'
# True
'isa' in 'this is a string'
# False
5 not in [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
# True
5 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
# False
